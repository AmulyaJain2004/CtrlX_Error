# Email Sending Issue - Fixed

## The Issue We Found

We thoroughly investigated the email sending functionality and found two key issues:

1. **Missing `EMAIL_USER` in .env file:**
   - The .env file was missing the `EMAIL_USER` configuration value which is required to authenticate with Gmail
   - We added the missing configuration value to match the `EMAIL_FROM` value

2. **Gmail Authentication Error:**
   - Gmail requires an App Password for authentication when using programmatic access
   - The current password format in the .env file is incorrect (contains quotes and may not be an app password)

## How to Fix Gmail Authentication

For the "Forgot Password" email functionality to work, you need to set up a proper Gmail App Password:

1. **Go to your Google Account:**
   - Visit https://myaccount.google.com
   - Sign in with the Gmail account you want to use for sending emails (bugtracker.updates@gmail.com)

2. **Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled:**
   - Go to Security > 2-Step Verification
   - Follow the steps to enable it

3. **Create an App Password:**
   - After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to the Security page
   - Look for "App passwords" (usually under "Signing in to Google")
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other (Custom name)" as the device and enter "TaskManagementSystem"
   - Click "Generate"

4. **Copy the App Password:**
   - Google will generate a 16-character password
   - Copy this password (it will look like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

5. **Update your .env file:**
   - Open the .env file in the backend directory
   - Update the EMAIL_PASSWORD line to use the new app password WITHOUT quotes and WITHOUT spaces:
   ```
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
   ```

6. **Restart your server:**
   - After saving the .env file, restart your Node.js server

## Testing Email Functionality

1. Run the email test script to verify your configuration:
   ```
   node testEmail.js your-test-email@example.com
   ```

2. If the email test succeeds, try the forgot password functionality in the application

## Switching to Development Mode (Alternative)

If you want to test the password reset flow without sending actual emails:

1. Ensure your .env file has:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. In development mode, the reset link will be displayed in the UI rather than sent via email

## Technical Details

The email sending functionality uses:
- Nodemailer library to send emails
- Gmail as the email service provider
- Environment variables to store credentials
- A fallback mechanism in development mode to display links instead of sending emails

The fix we implemented ensures that:
1. All required environment variables are present
2. The Gmail authentication can succeed with proper app password format
3. Users can properly receive password reset emails

This should resolve all issues with the email sending functionality for password resets.
