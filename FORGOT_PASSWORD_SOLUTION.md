# Forgot Password Functionality Fix

## The Issue

The forgot password email functionality is not working because:

1. The system is trying to authenticate with Gmail using placeholder credentials
2. Gmail requires a valid app password for authentication
3. Since authentication fails, emails are not being sent

## How the Code Currently Works

The current flow is actually correct:

1. User enters their email in the frontend form
2. Frontend sends this email to the backend API
3. Backend creates a reset token and tries to send an email to the user's address
4. The email options correctly set the user's input email as the recipient:
   ```javascript
   // From authController.js
   const emailContent = {
       to: email.trim(), // User's email from the form
       subject: 'Password Reset Request',
       // ...rest of email content
   };
   ```
5. In development mode, if email authentication fails, the reset link is still returned in the API response

## How to Fix It

### Option 1: Use Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)

1. Edit your `.env` file to force development mode and comment out the EMAIL_PASSWORD:
   ```
   # Email Configuration - FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=bugtracker.updates@gmail.com
   # EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
   EMAIL_FROM=bugtracker.updates@gmail.com
   
   # Force development mode
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. When you use the forgot password form, the system will:
   - Process the request normally
   - Skip actual email sending
   - Display the reset link directly in the response (visible in the UI)
   - Allow you to click the link to reset your password

This approach is ideal for development and testing.

### Option 2: Set Up Real Email Sending

To make the system actually send emails:

1. Get a Gmail App Password:
   - Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com
   - Enable 2-Step Verification
   - Go to Security â†’ App passwords
   - Create a new app password for "Mail" with custom name "TaskManagement"
   - Copy the 16-character password

2. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   # Email Configuration
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com  # Change to your Gmail
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop      # Your 16-character app password (no spaces)
   EMAIL_FROM=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com  # Change to your Gmail
   
   # For production mode
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. Restart your backend server

## Testing the Solution

### For Development Mode (Option 1):

1. Set `.env` as described in Option 1
2. Start your backend and frontend servers
3. Try the forgot password function
4. You'll see a debug section with the reset link directly on the page
5. Click the link to reset your password

### For Production Mode (Option 2):

1. Set `.env` as described in Option 2 with your real Gmail and app password
2. Start your backend and frontend servers
3. Try the forgot password function with your email address
4. Check your email inbox for the reset link
5. Click the link to reset your password

## Important Notes

- The current code is correctly using the user's input email as the recipient
- The email sending issue is purely an authentication problem with Gmail
- For production, consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid or Mailgun instead of Gmail
- Never commit your real email app password to version control
